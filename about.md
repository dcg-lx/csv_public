Convex and Solid-Voids is a research project developed by the Design Computing Group at Faculty of Architecture, University of Lisbon.

Convex voids are 3d representations of open urban spaces auto-generated based on the input of surrounding buildings, topography and other urban limits. They are utilized to measure multiple morphological attributes regarding urban spaces and are aggregated to form Solid-Voids which act as containers for this data.

The tools consist of a pre-processor, available for QGIS 2 (QGIS 3 version currently under development), or as a standalone CLI, and a series of Grasshopper algorithms.
You can submit issues in the [public repository](https://github.com/dcg-lx/csv_public){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. You can find the source code for the various packages at GitHub (by invitation), and a standalone CLI Docker image at Docker Hub (offline for the moment):
